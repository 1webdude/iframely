If you put a whitelist json file here, Iframely will start covering extra domains, converting responsive players, photos, etc. 

The file name is expected to be of "iframely-*.json" pattern. Lastest filename uploaded to this directory is used. 

You can get whitelist file with 900+ domains at [http://iframely.com/qa/buy](http://iframely.com/qa/buy). Or get a sample file with top 50 domains from the same page. 

If you wish to create your own whitelist, please, follow this [file format](http://iframely.com/qa/format).
