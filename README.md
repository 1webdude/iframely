# Iframely Embeds Gateway

[http://iframely.com](http://iframely.com)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/itteco/iframely.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/itteco/iframely)

Iframely is self-hosted embeds gateway, giving you single endpoint to get rich embeds data of any URL. 

Iframely is Node.JS app (and/or package), but you can access it from other environments via API.
Main endpoint (see [example](http://iframely.com/iframely?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F67452063)):

    /iframely?uri={url encoded http link to a web page}


Iframely provides out-of-the-box:

 - Generic parsers of [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), [oEmbed v1](http://oembed.com/) and Readability articles
 - Caching for performance optimizations (Memached, Redis or in-memory engines)
 - API for unified/merged meta, thumbnails (incl sizes), video, players, articles
 - Plugins ar—Åhitecture to extend the logic or to implement custom domain parsers
 - More than 100 parsers for specific domains, like YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, Instagram, etc.

## Getting Started

### Do not forget :)

- To give Iframely a star on GitHub
- To [follow Iframely on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iframely) or watch this repo to get updates


### Community Endpoint

__Please note__: You may use skip installation and use community endpoint to rapidly develop against it:

    http://iframely.com/iframely?uri=

This endpoint is provided courtesy of Itteco and has the latest version of iframely deployed. It is subject to restarts and rate-limits and thus is not suitable for production use. 

Please deploy iframely on your own hardware before going live.


### Quick API Response Intro

In response to `/iframely?uri=` requests, Iframely will return JSON with the embed links and unified meta semantics.


Response structure is close resemblance of the following analogue of `<head>` part of the URL's page:

    <head>
        <meta name="..." value="..."/>
        <link rel="iframely player" href="..." type="text/html" media="aspect-ratio: 1.778" title="...">
    </head>

JSON response will look like:

    {
      "meta": {                                         -- Unified meta object, see description in next section.
        "title": "BLACK&BLUE",                          -- Page title attribte.
        ...
      },
      "links": [                                        -- Array of links which can be rendered.
        {
          "href": "//player.vimeo.com/video/67452063",  -- URI of link. If both http and https are available, starts with `//`
          "type": "text/html",                          -- MIME type of link content.
          "rel": [                                      -- Array of link semantic types.
            "player",                                   -- `player` - is widget playing some media.
            "iframely"                                  -- `iframely` - indicates custom code of Iframely:
                                                            in this example, we added responsive `aspect-ratio` and `//` 
          ],
          "title": "BLACK&BLUE",                        -- Usual html link title attribute, equals meta.title.
          "media": {                                    -- "media query" semantics to provide widget media properties.
            "aspect-ratio": 1.778                       -- This means widget is responsive and proportionally resizable.
          }
        },
        ...
      ]
    }


You can use `iframely.js` jQuery script to communicate with Iframely endpoint and render the embeds. 
See `docs` folder for more details on API and `iframely.js`
